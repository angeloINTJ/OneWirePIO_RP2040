# Contributing to OneWirePIO_RP2040

Thank you for your interest in improving this library! Here's how to get started.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

- Use the [Bug Report](https://github.com/angeloINTJ/OneWirePIO_RP2040/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) issue template
- Include your board model, Arduino core version, and a minimal sketch to reproduce

### Suggesting Features

- Use the [Feature Request](https://github.com/angeloINTJ/OneWirePIO_RP2040/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) issue template
- Explain the use case and expected behavior

### Submitting Code

1. **Fork** the repository
2. Create a **feature branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. Make your changes following the code style below
4. **Test** on real hardware (Raspberry Pi Pico or Pico W)
5. **Commit** with a clear message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add: brief description of what was added"
   ```
6. **Push** and open a **Pull Request**

## Code Style

- **Language**: C++ (Arduino-compatible)
- **Comments**: English, Doxygen-style (`@brief`, `@param`, `@return`) for public API
- **Indentation**: 4 spaces (no tabs)
- **Braces**: K&R style (opening brace on same line)
- **Naming**: `camelCase` for methods, `_camelCase` for private members, `UPPER_CASE` for constants
- **Casts**: Use C++ casts (`static_cast<>`) instead of C-style casts

## Commit Message Convention

```
Add:    new feature or file
Fix:    bug fix
Docs:   documentation only
Refactor: code change that doesn't fix a bug or add a feature
Test:   adding or updating examples
```

## What We're Looking For

- Multi-device ROM search (Search ROM algorithm)
- Parasite power mode support
- Alarm / threshold temperature features
- Support for other 1-Wire devices (DS18S20, DS2438, etc.)
- Performance benchmarks and optimization
- Documentation improvements and translations
